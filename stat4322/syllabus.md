#### Class Time:

Zoom
M,W,F | Period 7 (1:55 PM - 2:45 PM)

#### Required Textbox:

7th edition of Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer (WMS)

#### Prerequisites:
STA 4321 (Introduction to Probability) 
MAC 2311, 2312, 2313 (Calculus I, II, III)

#### Objective:
This course uses mathematical statistics to provide a rigorous understanding of statistical inference, such as point estimation and hypothesis testing. We will cover the following topics: function of random variable, sampling distributions, central limit theorem, estimation, properties of point estimators, hypothesis testing.

#### Course Schedule:
The course covers Chapter 6-10 in the book of WMS. We will spend approximately two weeks in each chapter.

#### Grading and exams:
The total score grade consists of:

| Percentage | Source | Date |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 25%  | Homework          |                                 |
| 25%  | 1st exam |  |
| 25%  | 2nd exam | |
| 25%  | 3nd exam |   |


Note: if there's any disagreement on the score you get for homework / exam, you have *one week of time to appeal* to the instructor after getting your exams back.


All exams are closed-book, however, you may bring one sheet of formula into exams. The sheet can be written on both sides.

The letter grade is tentatively planned as the 10-point scale (90% for an A, 80% for a B, ...), subject to change depending on the final score distribution.

Information on current University of Florida grading policies for assigning grade points is given at:
   https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/grades.aspx

#### Homework:

Weekly homework of 1-2 problems will be assigned and posted on the course webiste. Each homework is due at the ***beginning*** of Monday lecture. Please hand in the homework ***in person*** to the instructor (i.e. do not email, do not give it to the TA).

***No late homework will be accepted***, except for medical reason with the doctor's note. 

#### Class Attendance and Make-up Exams:

You are expected to attend the class. Requirements for class attendance and make-up exams, assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found at:
   https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/attendance.aspx

#### Students with Disabilities:
Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with the Disability Resource Center (352-392-8565, www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/) by providing appropriate documentation. Once registered, students will receive an accommodation letter which must be presented to the instructor when requesting accommodation. Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early as possible in the semester.

#### Online Course Evaluation Process:
Students are expected to provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing online evaluations at https://evaluations.ufl.edu. Evaluations are typically open during the last two or three weeks of the semester, but students will be given specific times when they are open. Summary results of these evaluations are available to students at https://evaluations.ufl.edu/results/.

#### Zoom recording policy

Our class sessions may be audio-visually recorded for students in the class to refer back and for enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded.  If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voice recorded.  If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live. The chat will not be recorded or shared. As in all courses, unauthorized recording and unauthorized sharing of recorded materials by students or any other party is prohibited.
