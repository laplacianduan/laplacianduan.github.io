#### Required Textbox:

7th edition of Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer (WMS)

#### Prerequisites:
STA 4321 (Introduction to Probability) 
MAC 2311, 2312, 2313 (Calculus I, II, III)

#### Objective:
This course uses mathematical statistics to provide a rigorous understanding of statistical inference, such as point estimation and hypothesis testing. We will cover the following topics: sampling distributions, central limit theorem, estimation, properties of point estimators, hypothesis testing, linear models and least sqaure.

#### Course Schedule:
The course covers Chapter 7-11 in the book of WMS. We will spend approximately two weeks in each chapter.

#### Grading and exams:
The total score grade consists of:

| Percentage | Source | Date |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 20%  | Homework          |                                 |
| 20%  | 1st Mid-term exam | in class, scheduled on Sep 28   |
| 20%  | 2nd Mid-term exam | in class, scheduled on Oct 31  |
| 40%  | Final exam        | 12/10/2018 @ 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM |


All exams are closed-book, however, you may bring one sheet of formula into exams. The sheet can be written on both sides.

The letter grade is tentatively planned as the 10-point scale (90% for an A, 80% for a B, ...), subject to change depending on the final score distribution.

Information on current University of Florida grading policies for assigning grade points is given at:
   https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/grades.aspx

#### Homework:

Weekly homework of 1-2 problems will be assigned and posted on the course webiste. Each homework is due at the ***beginning*** of Monday lecture. Please hand in the homework ***in person*** to the instructor (i.e. do not email, do not give it to the TA).

***No late homework will be accepted***, except for medical reason with the doctor's note. 

#### Class Attendance and Make-up Exams:

You are expected to attend the class. Requirements for class attendance and make-up exams, assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found at:
   https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/attendance.aspx

#### Students with Disabilities:
Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with the Disability Resource Center (352-392-8565, www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/) by providing appropriate documentation. Once registered, students will receive an accommodation letter which must be presented to the instructor when requesting accommodation. Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early as possible in the semester.

#### Online Course Evaluation Process:
Students are expected to provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing online evaluations at https://evaluations.ufl.edu. Evaluations are typically open during the last two or three weeks of the semester, but students will be given specific times when they are open. Summary results of these evaluations are available to students at https://evaluations.ufl.edu/results/.
