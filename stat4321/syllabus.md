#### Required Textbox:

7th edition of Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer (WMS)

#### Prerequisites:
MAC 2313 with a minimum grade C

#### Objective:
The sequence of courses STA 4321-4322 (rep. 5325-5328) provides a
formal and systematic introduction to mathematical statistics for students who have
passed three semesters of standard undergraduate level calculus. STA 4321/5325
introduces the background in probability that is necessary to understand the classical
statistical theory introduced in STA 4322/5328. Major topics include the basic formal
elements of probability, discrete and continuous random variables, multivariate
distributions, distributions of functions of random variables, and fundamental limit
theorems. 

#### Course Schedule:
The course covers Chapter 1-6 in the book of WMS. We will spend approximately two weeks in each chapter.

#### Grading and exams:
The total score grade consists of:

| Percentage | Source | Date |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 25%  | Homework          |                                 |
| 25%  | 1st exam 		   | in class, scheduled on Feb 8	 |
| 25%  | 2nd exam 		   | in class, scheduled on Mar 22   |
| 25%  | 3rd exam          | in class, scheduled on Apr 24   |


Note: if there's any disagreement on the score you get for homework / exam, you have *one week of time to appeal* to the instructor after getting your exams back.


All exams are closed-book, however, you may bring one sheet of formula into exams. The sheet can be written on both sides.

The letter grade is tentatively planned as the 10-point scale (90% for an A, 80% for a B, ...), subject to change depending on the final score distribution.

Information on current University of Florida grading policies for assigning grade points is given at:
   https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/grades.aspx

#### Homework:

Bi-weekly homework of 3-4 problems will be assigned and posted on the course webiste. Each homework is due at the ***beginning*** of Monday lecture. Please hand in the homework ***in person*** to the instructor (i.e. do not email, do not give it to the TA).

***No late homework will be accepted***, except for medical reason with the doctor's note. 

#### Class Attendance and Make-up Exams:

You are expected to attend the class. Requirements for class attendance and make-up exams, assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found at:
   https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/attendance.aspx

#### Students with Disabilities:
Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with the Disability Resource Center (352-392-8565, www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/) by providing appropriate documentation. Once registered, students will receive an accommodation letter which must be presented to the instructor when requesting accommodation. Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early as possible in the semester.

#### Online Course Evaluation Process:
Students are expected to provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing online evaluations at https://evaluations.ufl.edu. Evaluations are typically open during the last two or three weeks of the semester, but students will be given specific times when they are open. Summary results of these evaluations are available to students at https://evaluations.ufl.edu/results/.
